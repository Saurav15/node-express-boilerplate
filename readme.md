- **Logging**: Utilizes Winston and Morgan for comprehensive request and event logging.
- **Database Integration**: Easily integrates with MongoDB for your data storage needs.
- **Standard Response Schema**: All responses follow a consistent data structure for clarity and consistency.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file using `example.env` as a reference.
4. Configure environment variables as needed, such as database connection settings.
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. The server will run at http://localhost:8081 by default.

## Routes

### Health Check

- **Route**: `/health-check`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Verify server health, including database connectivity.

### Signup

- **Route**: `/signup`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: User registration route.

### Login

- **Route**: `/login`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: User login route.

### Private

- **Route**: `/private`

## Authentication

This boilerplate includes authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can sign up, log in, and receive access tokens for protected routes.

## Error Handling

The project features custom exception handling. Errors are captured and returned with appropriate status codes and messages for easy debugging.

## Configuration and Constants

Configuration variables and constants are stored in a `.env` file. Refer to `example.env` for guidance on environment variable setup.

## Input Validation

Input validation is implemented using the Joi library. The `schema` folder contains files for validating request bodies.

## Logging

Winston and Morgan are used for logging. Logs are generated for various events and requests, providing you with detailed insights into application behavior.

## Database Integration

The boilerplate is configured to work with MongoDB for data storage. Update database connection settings in your `.env` file.

## Standard Response Schema

All responses adhere to a standard schema for consistency. This schema includes fields like `success`, `message`, and `data`.

Feel free to customize and extend this boilerplate to meet your project requirements.
